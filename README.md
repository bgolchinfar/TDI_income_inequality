# Minimizing the World Income Inequality: Influential Parameters
This project is proposed for the TDI capstone project.

## Problem Statement
* Get an insight of how to minimize the income inequality?
* Reducing Income Inequality among the 17 sustainable development goals (call for action for all countries)

The [code](/WIID_May2020.ipynb) to preprocess and anayze the data is written in python.   
## Data Analysis
10 Countries with the highest and lowest gini index averaged over the past 10 years are selected. 
The below bar graphs show two extreme of population in regards to education in these countries.

## Next Steps
* Study other involved parameters
* Implement machine learning algorithms to the correlated parameters
* Predict the effect of each parameter based on the available data 
* Make an interactive dashboard for the customers
