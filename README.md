## Data Analysis
10 Countries with the highest and lowest gini index averaged over the past 10 years are selected. 
The below bar graphs show two extreme of population in regards to education in these countries.

## Next Steps
* Study other involved parameters
* Implement machine learning algorithms to the correlated parameters
* Predict the effect of each parameter based on the available data 
* Make an interactive dashboard for the customers
